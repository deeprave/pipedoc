# Pipe Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document tracks the improvements needed for the named pipe connection handling in Pipedoc. The current implementation has several issues related to thread management and connection handling that need to be addressed.

## Current Issues

1. **Preemptive Thread Spawning**: Threads are created continuously in anticipation of clients, not in response to actual connections
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Unbounded thread creation can lead to memory and thread pool exhaustion
3. **No Connection Limiting**: No mechanism to limit concurrent connections or manage thread pool
4. **Race Conditions**: Potential for clients to connect when no writer is available

## Tasks

### PD-001: Implement Reactive Thread Management
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Replace the current preemptive thread spawning with a reactive model that only creates threads when clients actually connect.

**Requirements**:
- Only create worker threads to serve readers when needed
- Minimize the number of threads created
- If a worker thread blocks on writing, no additional threads should be created until necessary

### PD-002: Add Thread Pool Management
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Implement proper thread pool management using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.

**Requirements**:
- Limit maximum number of concurrent threads
- Properly recycle threads after use
- Clean shutdown of thread pool
- Configuration for pool size

### PD-003: Handle Connection Race Conditions
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Implement a solution to prevent race conditions where clients connect but no writer is available.

**Requirements**:
- Maintain at least one writer ready to accept connections
- When a writer unblocks, ensure another thread is ready to take over
- Handle multiple simultaneous connection attempts gracefully

### PD-004: Create Enhanced Pipe Manager
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Design and implement a better thread manager that encapsulates the pipe lifecycle more effectively than the current threading module approach.

**Requirements**:
- Clear separation of concerns between pipe management and thread management
- Better abstraction for connection handling
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Monitoring and metrics for active connections

### PD-005: Implement Connection Queueing
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Add a queueing mechanism for incoming connections to handle bursts of simultaneous clients.

**Requirements**:
- Queue pending connections when all threads are busy
- Configurable queue size
- Timeout handling for queued connections
- Fair scheduling of queued connections

### PD-006: Add Connection Lifecycle Events
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Low  
**Description**: Implement event-based handling for connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, error).

**Requirements**:
- Event callbacks for connection state changes
- Logging and monitoring hooks
- Statistics collection (connection count, duration, errors)

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with PD-001 to establish the reactive model
2. Implement PD-002 for proper thread pool management
3. Address PD-003 to handle race conditions
4. Refactor with PD-004 for better architecture
5. Enhance with PD-005 and PD-006 as needed

## Technical Considerations

- Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for thread management
- Consider using `select` or `epoll` for monitoring pipe readiness
- Implement proper synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores)
- Ensure graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Write thorough unit tests for all scenarios

## Success Criteria

- No unbounded thread creation
- Efficient resource utilization
- No race conditions or dropped connections
- Clean, maintainable code following SOLID principles
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance benchmarks showing improvement
